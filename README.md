# anagram_checker

The Anagram Checker is a C++ program that allows users to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. This program ignores spaces and considers letter case-insensitivity when determining anagrams.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ library

## Instructions

1. Enter the first string when prompted: "Enter the first string: ".
2. Enter the second string when prompted: "Enter the second string: ".
3. The program will then check if the entered strings are anagrams.
4. If the strings are anagrams, it will display the message "The strings are anagrams."
5. If the strings are not anagrams, it will display the message "The strings are not anagrams."
6. The program will then prompt you to continue or exit: "Do you want to continue? (Y/N): ".
7. Enter 'Y' or 'y' to continue checking anagrams or 'N' or 'n' to exit the program.
8. If you choose to continue, you will be prompted to enter new strings, and the process repeats.
9. The program will keep running until you choose to exit.

## Notes
The program ignores spaces and treats the strings as case-insensitive. For example, "debit card" and "bad credit" would be considered anagrams.
The program uses the standard C++ library and does not require any external dependencies.
